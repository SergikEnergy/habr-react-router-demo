# React Router - Advanced Usage

## This repository was created for using as a playground of react router v.7 as a library (not as a framework)

Demonstrate using loader function with react router children's approach, that allows to use additional useful functionality.

You can combine Awaited and Suspense to get simpler way to show fallback components for more user experience and reduce code complexity.

React router v7 with this approach also opens new opportunities to use loader, action, lazy load, inbuilt ErrorBoundary and error fallback components

_For more details you can look at the [Official documentation router7](https://reactrouter.com/home)_
